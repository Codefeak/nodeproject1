		<p>Hello Dear, Welcome to my first assignment on use of Nodejs. By implementing this assignment you will learn how to use different node modules. These are the node modules which  will be used in  this project:
			<ul>
				<li>http</li>
				<li>fs</li>
				<li>Os</li>
			</ul>

		The application will have home, about and contact page and each page will have a navigation(menu). When a user navigates on different part of the application, the application will track the user and collects information.  All the information collected about the user will be saved in track.user.txt file.
		The contact page will have a form with firstname, lastname, email and message field and it sends an email to the application owner(admin) by clicking submit.
		Every tracked activity will be on a separate line as in shown below.
		//track.user.activity.txt
